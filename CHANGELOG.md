## v0.6.0

> Release date: 2023-07-20

### Added

- Added `Ready`, `ReadyReplicas` and `Replicas` fields to `DataPlane`'s Status
  [#854](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/854)
- Added `Rollout` field to `DataPlane` CRD. This allows specification of rollout strategy
  and behavior (e.g. to enable blue/green rollouts for upgrades).
  [#879](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/879)

### Changes

> **WARN**: Breaking changes included

- Renamed `Services` options in `DataPlaneOptions` to `Network` options, which
  now includes `IngressService` as one of the sub-attributes.
  This is a **breaking change** which requires some renaming and reworking of
  struct attribute access.
  [#849](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/849)
- Bump Gateway API to v0.6.2 and enable Gateway API conformance testing.
  [#853](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/853)
- Add `PodTemplateSpec` to `DeploymentOptions` to allow applying strategic merge
  patcher on top of `Pod`s generated by the operator.
  This is a **breaking change** which requires manual porting from `Pods` field
  to `PodTemplateSpec`.
  More info on strategic merge patch can be found in official Kubernetes docs at
  [sig-api-machinery/strategic-merge-patch.md][strategic-merge-patch].
  [#862](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/862)
- Added `v1beta1` version of the `DataPlane` API, which replaces the `v1alpha1`
  version. The `v1alpha1` version of the API has been removed entirely in favor
  of the new version to reduce maintenance costs.
  [#905](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/905)

### Fixes

- Fixes setting `Affinity` when generating `Deployment`s for `DataPlane`s
  `ControlPlane`s which caused 2 `ReplicaSet`s to be created where the first
  one should already have the `Affinity` set making the update unnecessary.
  [#894](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/894)

## v0.5.0

> Release date: 2023-06-20

### Added

- Added `AddressSourceType` to `DataPlane` status `Address`
  [#798](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/798)
- Add pod Affinity field to `PodOptions` and support for both `DataPlane` and `ControlPlane`
- Add Kong Gateway enterprise image - `kong/kong-gateway` - to the set of supported
  `DataPlane` images.
  [#749](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/749)
- Moved pod related options in `DeploymentOptions` to `PodsOptions` and added pod
  labels option.
  [#742](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/742)
- Added `Volumes` and `VolumeMounts` field in `DeploymentOptions` of `DataPlane`
  specs. Users can attach custom volumes and mount the volumes to proxy container
  of pods in `Deployments` of dataplanes.
  Note: `Volumes` and `VolumeMounts` are not supported for `ControlPlane` specs now.
  [#681](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/681)
- Added possibility to replicas on `DataPlane` deployments
  This allows users to define `DataPlane`s - without `ControlPlane` - to be
  horizontally scalable.
  [#737](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/737)
- Added possibility to specify `DataPlane` proxy service type
  [#739](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/739)
- Added possibility to specify resources through `DataPlane` and `ControlPlane`
  `spec.deployment.resources`
  [#712](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/712)
- The `DataPlane` spec has been updated with a new field related
  to the proxy service. By using such a field, it is possible to
  specify annotations to be set on the `DataPlane` proxy service.
  [#682](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/682)

### Changed

- Bumped default ControlPlane image to 2.9.3
  [#712](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/712)
  [#719](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/719)
- Bumped default DataPlane image to 3.2.2
  [#728](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/728)
- Bumped Gateway API to 0.6.1. Along with it, the deprecated `Gateway`
  `scheduled` condition has been replaced by the `accepted` condition.
  [#618](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/issues/618)
- `ControlPlane` and `DataPlane` specs have been refactored by explicitly setting
  the deployment field (instead of having it inline).
  [#725](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/725)
- `ControlPlane` and `DataPlane` specs now require users to provide `containerImage`
  and `version` fields.
  This is being enforced in the admission webhook.
  [#758](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/758)
- Validation for `ControlPlane` and `DataPlane` components no longer has a
  "ceiling", or maximum version. This due to popular demand, but now puts more
  emphasis on the user to troubleshoot when things go wrong. It's no longer
  possible to use a tag that's not semver compatible (e.g. 2.10.0) for these
  components (for instance, a branch such as `main`) without enabling developer
  mode.
  [#819](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/819)
- `ControlPlane` and `DataPlane` image validation now supports enterprise image
  flavours, e.g. `3.3.0-ubuntu`, `3.2.0.0-rhel` etc.
  [#830](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/830)

### Fixes

- Fix admission webhook certificates Job which caused TLS handshake errors when
  webhook was being called.
  [#716](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/716)
- Include leader election related role when generating `ControlPlane` RBAC
  manifests so that Gateway Discovery can be used by KIC.
  [#743](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/743)

## v0.4.0

> Release date: 2022-01-25

### Added

- Added machinery for ControlPlanes to communicate with DataPlanes
  directly via Pod IPs. The Admin API has been removed from the LoadBalancer service.
  [#609](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/609)
- The Gateway Listeners status is set and kept up to date by the Gateway controller.
  [#627](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/627)

## v0.3.0

  environment variables set in DataPlane
  [#473](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/473)
- Added Container image and version validation for ControlPlanes and DataPlanes.
  The operator now only supports the Kubernetes-ingress-controller (2.7) as
  the ControlPlane, and Kong (3.0) as the DataPlane.
  [#490](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/490)
- DataPlane resources get a new `Status` field: `Addresses` which will contain
  backing service addresses.
  [#483](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/483)

## v0.1.1

> Release date:  2022-09-24

**Maturity: ALPHA**

### Added

- `HTTPRoute` support was added. If version of control plane image is at 
  least 2.6, the `Gateway=true` feature gate is enabled, so the 
  control plane can pick up the `HTTPRoute` and configure it on data plane.
  [#302](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/302)  

## v0.1.0

> Release date: 2022-09-15

**Maturity: ALPHA**

This is the initial release which includes basic functionality at an alpha
level of maturity and includes some of the fundamental APIs needed to create
gateways for ingress traffic.

### Initial Features

- The `GatewayConfiguration` API was added to enable configuring `Gateway`
  resources with the options needed to influence the configuration of
  the underlying `ControlPlane` and `DataPlane` resources.
  [#43](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/pull/43)
- `GatewayClass` support was added to delineate which `Gateway` resources the
  operator supports.
  [#22](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/issues/22)
- `Gateway` support was added: used to create edge proxies for ingress traffic.
  [#6](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/issues/6)
- The `ControlPlane` API was added to deploy Kong Ingress Controllers which
  can be attached to `DataPlane` resources.
  [#5](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/issues/5)
- The `DataPlane` API was added to deploy Kong Gateways.
  [#4](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/issues/4)
- The operator manages certificates for control and data plane communication
  and configures mutual TLS between them. It cannot yet replace expired
  certificates.
  [#103](https://github.com/Kong/gateway-operator/issues/103)

### Known issues

When deploying the gateway-operator through the bundle, there might be some
leftovers from previous operator deployments in the cluster. The user needs to delete all the cluster-wide leftovers
(clusterrole, clusterrolebinding, validatingWebhookConfiguration) before
re-installing the operator through the bundle.
